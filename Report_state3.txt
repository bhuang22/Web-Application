In this homework,  we create the html form , and read the data after the header and body
of the file is sent. after we get the data, we store the data into the txt file. if the user
inputs any text in the html form, the data will be read from the local txt file and sent the stored
data to the server in order to display to the users. also, we use the same way to do the upload file 
. we first get the data , split them into different parts, and parse the datas into specific type.
Then, we send the data through the server.
