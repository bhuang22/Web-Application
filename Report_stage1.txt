In this homework, we create a docker file in order to build and run the image,
. after creating the image, we use the data variable to receive the data and store
in it. since the data store in the data variable are byte like object, we need to convert these
date into string, and split the string line by line using  on the new line(\r\n). by doing that,
these data act like an array, and we split the each line based on the space character. Then, we can 
distinguish the requestd type, requested path and the requested version of these data. because we already
obtain the requested type and the requested path , we can use these two elements to dintinguish if a request that
we receives is what we want. if a request a request is received for any path other than "/hello" or "/hi", it returns 404
response. otherwise, we can receive  200 or 301 resopnse.
