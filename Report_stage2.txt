In this homework, we create  a sample site that host index.html, style.css 
and function.js. before we send the request to the server, we use the type check operation to 
loop through the specific directory and determine what file we want to send through the TCP socket. 
after knowing the file type, we open/read the files and encode them. after finishing the encoding, 
we can send files that contain the cooresponding response,length, MIME type to the localhost. 



sample site (index.html) is stored in  the static folder

template html(template.html) stores in  images folder

bonus html (bonus.html) stores in bonus folder
