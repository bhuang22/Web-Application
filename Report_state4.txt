In this homework, we are working on the websocket handshake, so we need to upgrade the 
tcp socket to the websocket connection.  AFTER we upgrade to websocket, we can use the given js code
to send the json string to the server. since we already build the hand shake, the server will always keep
waiting for the data the client send. the problem is we also want to receive the server response and have 
the data back. thus, we need to mask the frame, demask. because of that, we can receive the server response.
since we get the data back, we can store the received data in the local data structure as history. also, we can
store the data in the mysql database. This would be more efficient since we can store the data permanently.
